The MA Where to Live Project originated from a table discovered on BostonMagazine.com
This table depicted average home prices across the Greater Boston Area.

Given Massachusetts' reputation for high housing costs, the project aims to assist potential homeowners in assessing whether these prices are justified.
we are considering factors like crime rates and education quality to determine our rankings.

To achieve this, data is sourced from various tables on BostonMagazine.com, providing historical single-family home pricing data.
Additionally, data available on mass.gov is utilized to enrich the analysis.

It's crucial to emphasize that the project focuses solely on cities within Massachusetts, comparing and contrasting their characteristics.
Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
