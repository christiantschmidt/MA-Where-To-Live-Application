  <h3>About The Project</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>"MA Where to Live Project"</strong> originated from a table discovered on 
    <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/boston-single-family-home-prices-by-town-in-2023/"><strong>BostonMagazine.com</strong></a>
    where it depicted the average single family home prices across the Greater Boston Area. 
    I thought back to when I bought a house and wished there was some sort of database that not only showed prices, but could also show important stats regarding education and crime rates too.
    There are paid services out there that score nationwide neighborhoods and towns (i.e. <a href=https://www.niche.com/"><strong>Niche</strong></a>), but I wanted to focus more locally on MA.
