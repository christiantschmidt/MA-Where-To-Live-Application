  <h3>About The Project</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>"MA Where to Live Project"</strong> originated from a table discovered on 
    <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/boston-single-family-home-prices-by-town-in-2023/"><strong>BostonMagazine.com</strong></a>
    where it depicted the average single family home prices across the Greater Boston Area. 
    I thought back to when I bought a house and wished there was some sort of database that not only showed prices, but could also show important stats regarding education and crime rates too.
    There are paid services out there that score nationwide neighborhoods and towns (i.e. <a href=https://www.niche.com/"><strong>Niche</strong></a>), but I wanted to focus more locally on MA.

  <h3>Where did I collect the Data?</h3>
  <p>
    I had two main sources of data:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/boston-single-family-home-prices-by-town-in-2023/"><strong>BostonMagazine.com</strong></a></li>
      <li><a href="https://data.mass.gov/"><strong>Data.Mass.gov</strong></a></li>
    </ul>
    BostonMagazine releases an annual single family home median price average for MA towns in the Greater Boston Area.
    That data is aggregated from real estate listing websites, giving as a shortcut in gathering the data, without having to rely on APIs.
    Data.Mass.gov also is an incredible treasure trove of data. You can find everything from Crime, Education, Demographics, etc...
