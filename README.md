  <h3>About The Project</h3>
  <p>
    The MA Where to Live Project originated from a table discovered on 
    <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/boston-single-family-home-prices-by-town-in-2023/"><strong>BostonMagazine.com</strong></a>
    where it depicted the average single family home prices across the Greater Boston Area. 
    I thought back to when I bought a house and wished there was some sort of database that not only shows prices, but could also show important stats like education and crime rates too.
    There are services out there that score nationwide neighborhoods and towns (i.e. <a href=https://www.niche.com/"><strong>Niche</strong></a>), but I wanted to focus more locally on MA.
