  <h3>About The Project</h3>
  <p>
    The "<a href="https://ynr0pw-christian-schmidt.shinyapps.io/MA-Where-to-Live-Project/"><strong>MA Where to Live Project</strong></a>" originated from a table discovered on 
    <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/boston-single-family-home-prices-by-town-in-2023/"><strong>BostonMagazine.com</strong></a>
    which depicted the average single-family home prices across the Greater Boston Area. 
    I thought back to when I bought a house and wished there was some sort of database that not only showed prices but could also display important stats regarding education and crime rates too.
    There are paid services out there that score nationwide neighborhoods and towns (i.e., <a href="https://www.niche.com/"><strong>Niche</strong></a>), but I wanted to focus more locally on MA.

  <h3>Where did I collect the Data?</h3>
  <p>
    I had two main sources of data:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/boston-single-family-home-prices-by-town-in-2023/"><strong>BostonMagazine.com</strong></a></li>
      <li><a href="https://data.mass.gov/"><strong>Data.Mass.gov</strong></a></li>
    </ul>
    BostonMagazine releases an annual single-family home median price average for MA towns in the Greater Boston Area.
    That data is aggregated from real estate listing websites, providing a shortcut in gathering the data without having to rely on APIs.
    Data.Mass.gov is also an incredible treasure trove of data. You can find everything from Crime, Education, Demographics, etc...
  </p>

  <h3>Why this data?</h3>
  <p>
    Homebuyers can have changing commutes and jobs, especially now with most companies adopting remote or hybrid work schedules.
    However, <strong>Schools and Crime</strong> are not something that you can change so easily.
    That is why I decided to focus on these two data points, as well as home prices, so potential buyers can compare if it's really worth living in a higher-priced area vs. lower-priced areas.
